Maritime Object Classification with Few-Shot Learning
==============================

## Project objective
This project entails the use of few shot learning to classify images of marine objects. The experiments involve a feature detector (Resnet18) that is custom trained on maritime data and used to predict both seen and unseen classes with a prototypical network.

## About the project
This project is part of Rian Leevinson Jayakumar's master thesis at the Technical University of Denmark as part of the M.Sc. study programme of Autonomous Systems.
